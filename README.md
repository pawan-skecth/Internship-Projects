### 1. DEEP CSAT - E-COMMERCE Project

This project focuses on predicting Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores in an e-commerce context using Deep Learning Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

* **Objective**: The primary goal is to accurately forecast CSAT scores based on various interaction-related features. This provides actionable insights to enhance service quality, improve customer retention, and drive overall business growth.
* **Problem Solved**: Traditionally, companies rely on direct surveys for CSAT, which can be time-consuming. This project aims to overcome that by predicting CSAT scores in real-time, offering a more granular view of service performance and identifying areas for immediate improvement.
* **Approach**: The project utilizes deep learning models to predict CSAT scores based on various parameters.
* **Dataset**: The project uses the `eCommerce_Customer_support_data.csv` dataset. It includes customer support interaction details such as `Unique id`, `channel_name`, `category`, `Sub-category`, `Customer Remarks`, `Order_id`, `order_date_time`, `Issue_reported at`, `issue_responded`, `Survey_response_Date`, `Customer_City`, `Product_category`, `Item_price`, `connected_handling_time`, `Agent_name`, `Supervisor`, `Manager`, `Tenure Bucket`, `Agent Shift`, and `CSAT Score`.
* **Libraries Used**: The project imports `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `seaborn` for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

### 2. Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project involves an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a 2019 Netflix dataset.

* **Project Summary**: The analysis focuses on understanding trends in movies and TV shows available on Netflix. It aims to reveal insights into content availability by country and to determine if Netflix's content strategy has shifted towards producing more TV shows than movies in recent years. A 2018 report indicated a tripling of TV shows and a decrease in movies since 2010.
* **Problem Statement**: The project seeks to understand the geographical distribution of different content types (movies vs. TV shows) and to assess Netflix's focus on TV shows versus movies over time.
* **Business Objective**: The core business objective is to derive actionable insights from the dataset to help Netflix make informed decisions about content production and develop strategies for business growth in various international markets.
* **Dataset**: The project utilizes the `NETFLIX MOVIES AND TV SHOWS CLUSTERING.csv` dataset. This dataset contains information including `show_id`, `type` (movie/TV show), `title`, `director`, `cast`, `country`, `date_added`, `release_year`, `rating`, `duration`, `listed_in` (genres), and `description`.
* **Libraries Used**: Key libraries for data analysis and visualization such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib.pyplot` are used.

### 3. Integrated Retail Analytics Project

This project focuses on providing comprehensive retail analytics to optimize store performance, forecast demand, and enhance customer experience through personalized marketing strategies.

* **Optimized Store Performance**: The project identifies unusual fluctuations in sales early by applying anomaly detection and analyzing sales trends. This enables more effective inventory management and smoother store operations, ultimately reducing losses and improving efficiency.
* **Forecasted Demand**: A demand forecasting model is developed, which achieved a high R-squared value, indicating strong accuracy in predicting future sales. This reliable forecast aids in better planning of stock levels, preventing both product shortages and excess inventory.
* **Enhanced Customer Experience via Segmentation**: The project groups customers into distinct segments based on their buying behavior and preferences. This segmentation allows for customized marketing efforts, making promotions more relevant and significantly improving overall customer satisfaction.
* **Personalized Marketing Strategies**: Tailored marketing offers, such as discounts, free shipping, or buy-one-get-one deals, are assigned to different customer clusters. This personalized approach boosts the effectiveness of campaigns by targeting the right customers with the most relevant offers, leading to higher engagement and sales growth.
* **Libraries Used**: The project uses `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `seaborn` for data analysis, manipulation, and visualization.
* **Datasets**: The project leverages multiple datasets including `Features data set.csv`, `sales data-set.csv`, and `stores data-set.csv`.
